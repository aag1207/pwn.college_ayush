# Description
Bypassing the second chamber leads to an empty floor except for a single artifact in the center: an old MP3 player, scratched and worn. On its surface, a cipher is etched, a message left behind for anyone who can decode it: twj eys zpr ukm 'viamnwqw' bx lzgo: esmqqui{yyr_oshwwcm_bwupa} When you power it on, the sound fills the chamber. The tracks play like whispers from a lost world, and you recognize it as a song from Panchiko’s latest studio album, particularly track no. 8. Its title feels familiar, hinting at a famous cipher. Decrypt it by using the album name as your key and continue your ascent.

First, I found track 8 of Panchinko's latest album, it's name was found to be Vinegar. I then applied the "Vigenère decode" with the key "ginkgo" on the given ciphertext, as Ginkgo is currently the latest Panchiko album & track number 8 is named Vinegar, using just the flag portion and key panchiko you get the flag.
