# Description
As you step into the second chamber, a figure manifests before you. Before you stands a forgotten deity, a dead god spoken of only in whispers. Known by countless names: “Apostle of Epilogue and Eternity,” “Lone Messiah” and many more lost to time.

They leave nothing but a single image, a relic carrying his final secret. Hidden within its layers lies the key to ascend to the next chamber.

First, an image was given. I inputed the image in a hex editor, in the meta data it was written that the author had a habit of hiding images within images. So based on this clue, I kept the image in the cyberchef website and then extracted the text and images embedded within the image given. One image was extracted which had the flag.
