# 1. Intro to Commands
This challenge asks to execute our first command. We were told to invoke the "hello" command in this case

## My solve
**pwn.college{MCoNx8RRDMFnuwMK7m9IlsbQKrh.QX3YjM1wCO1EzNzEzW}**

I was first taught with an example to execute the "whoami" command. I then entered "hello" in the terminal as per the challege to get the output and the key. I made sure to input the command "hello" all in small caps, since commands are case sensitive.

'''
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MCoNx8RRDMFnuwMK7m9IlsbQKrh.QX3YjM1wCO1EzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learnt
I learnt how to execute my first program "hello" and that commands are case sensitive. "hello" and "HELLO" are not the same.

# 2. Intro to Arguments
This challenge asks us to execute a command with an argument or condition. In this case we were to execute the hello command with the hackers argument.

## My solve
**pwn.college{MWzQ81arAMs5el-C3HHjkm1PpmX.QX4YjM1wCO1EzNzEzW}**

I was first taught that a command is what is to be executed while an argument is the parameters of the command. In the example given, "echo" is the command while "hello hackers!" is the argument. I then entered "hello" as a command and "hackers" as the argument mentioned in the challenge to execute the program.

'''
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MWzQ81arAMs5el-C3HHjkm1PpmX.QX4YjM1wCO1EzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learnt
I have learnt that a command and an argument are separated by a space. The argument sets the parameters for the command.

# 3. Command History
This challenge asks us to explore the command history. The commands used prior can be accessed by clicking the up arrow for easier execution.

## My solve
**pwn.college{s4pxnEFlgU1PtVqeTqcKJzcJGqU.0lNzEzNxwCO1EzNzEzW}**

I was first taught how to access my command history. Following the instructions, I clicked on the up arrow to access my prior commands.

'''
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{s4pxnEFlgU1PtVqeTqcKJzcJGqU.0lNzEzNxwCO1EzNzEzW}^C
'''

## What I learnt
I have learnt that we do not have to rewrite commands everytime. If we have to access commands used prior, we can just click on the up arrow to save time.
